<p>Big sister, little sister, red sister: three woman at the heart of twentieth-century China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, the story goes, there were there sisters. One loved money, one loved power, and one loved her country.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The extraordinary lives of the soongs were made possible by a confluence of globalization, modernization and Western penetration of an ancient, tottering empire.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For her grace and magnetism, May-ling was a woman fatally addicted to luxury, and EI-ling spent much of her life playing politics to maintain an opulent lifestyle for the Soong clan.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>As China struggled to define itself against the Western world, the sisters were discovering how to be a new kind of Chinese: cos-mopolitian, enlightened and, most unprecedented for a woman, liberated.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Ching-ling fared no better, heedlessly sacrificing herself for a revolution she didn’t understand until it was too late. Red sister might have begun life emulating joan of Arc, but he fate more closely resembled that of Dorothea Brooke.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Unlike in a fairy tale, there was no magical ending to the Soong saga. </p>
<p>Each sister made her choice early, and by the time she pasued to consider the arc of her life, the world had moved on and she was no longer in a position to walk back her youthful convictions. As Ching-ling  coolly put it during her last years, in words that sound like an attempt to persuade herself as much as anyone else, “I made my choice and I have no regrets.”</p>
<p>ps：电影《修女也疯狂》的英文原名也是Sister act。</p>
